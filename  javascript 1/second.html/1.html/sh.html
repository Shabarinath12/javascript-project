         <h2>NEWTON</h2> 
         <p>Motion, move, movement refer to change of position in space. Motion denotes change of position, 
             either considered apart from, or as a characteristic of, something that moves; usually the former, 
             in which case it is often a somewhat technical or scientific term: perpetual motion. The chief uses 
             of move are founded upon the idea of moving a piece, in chess or a similar game, for winning the game,
              and hence the word denotes any change of position, condition, or circumstances for the accomplishment 
              of some end: a shrewd move to win votes. Movement is always connected with the person or thing moving,
               and is usually a definite or particular motion: the movements of a dance. 3. bearing, carriage.</p>
